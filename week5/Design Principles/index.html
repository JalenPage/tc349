	<h2>Chunking</h2>
	<h3>Good example</h3>
	<img src="img/chunk_good.jpg" width="1200" height="700" />
	<p><a href="http://dorkismo.tumblr.com/">http://dorkismo.tumblr.com</a></p>
	<p>I think this is a really good example of chunking because it does not use a ton of information at one time so the reader would have a better time remembering the things that they read.</p>

	<h3>Bad example</h3>
	<img src="img/chunk_bad.jpg" width="1200" height="700" />
	<p><a href="http://www.aquariusrecords.org/">http://www.aquariusrecords.org</a></p>
	<p>This is a really bad example of chunking because there is so much information bunched up in 1 major area that if someone was to visit this website, they might feel overwealmed by information.</p>

	<h2>Signal-To-Noise Ratio</h2>
	<h3>Good example</h3>
	<img src="img/noise_good.jpg" width="1200" height="700" />
	<p><a href="http://suspectdevice.net/">http://suspectdevice.net</a></p>
	<p>I think this is a really good example of signal-to-noise ratio because this website does not have a lot of additional things going on that could potentionally draw someones attention away from the main purpose of the website itself. </p>

	<h3>Bad example</h3>
	<img src="img/noise_bad.jpg" width="1200" height="700" />
	<p><a href="http://www.panorama.gi/">http://www.panorama.gi</a></p>
	<p>I think this is a really bad example of signal-to-noise ratio because there are a lot going of things for viewers to look at and not enought open area on this webpage.</p>
 
 	<h2>Ockham's Razor</h2>
	<h3>Good example</h3>
	<img src="img/razor_good.jpg" width="1200" height="700" />
	<p><a href="http://blog.codinghorror.com/">http://blog.codinghorror.com</a></p>
	<p>I think this is a really good example of Ockham's Razor because it is a nice simple design that gets the job done. It is not overly done and bombarded with a lot of colors and things of that nature.</p>
        
	<h3>Bad example</h3>
	<img src="img/razor_bad.jpg" width="1200" height="700" />
	<p><a href="http://www.lab404.com/dreams/library.html">http://www.lab404.com/dreams/library.html</a></p>
	<p>I think this is a really bad example of Ockham's Razor because this website has entirely too much going on. The background color is entirely too bright and it is very hard to understand the main purpose of this website.</p>
        
 	<h2>Golden Ratio</h2>
	<h3>Good example</h3>
	<img src="img/golden_good.jpg" width="1200" height="700" />
	<p><a href="http://www.isseymiyake.com/">http://www.isseymiyake.com</a></p>
	<p>I think this is a really good example of Golden Ratio because this website is proportionally sound. Everything on this website goes together from the width, to the height, to the margins. It looks very well put together.</p>
      
	<h3>Bad example</h3>
	<img src="img/golden_bad.jpg" width="1200" height="700" />
	<p><a href="http://calarts.edu/">http://calarts.edu</a></p>
	<p>I think this is a really bad example of Golden Ratio because the margins on this webpage are completely off. Different sections of this websites are at different heights and some of them are even overlapping one another.</p>

 	<h2>Hick's Law</h2>
	<h3>Good example</h3>
	<img src="img/hicks_good.jpg" width="1200" height="700" />
	<p><a href="http://www.blind.com/">http://www.blind.com</a></p>
	<p>I think this is a really good example of Hicks's Law because this website is very simple and it does not give you a ton of different things that you can click on. This makes it very easy for viewers to navigate through this webpage.</p>

	<h3>Bad example</h3>
	<img src="img/hicks_bad.jpg" width="1200" height="700" />
	<p><a href="http://www.macleans.ca/">http://www.macleans.ca</a></p>
	<p>I think this is a really bad example of Hicks's Law because there are so many different things that viewers can click on. The drop down menus have a lot of different options and that can be a bit overwhelming for someone who does not like a ton of information.</p>
